# 🔧 ESLint Issues Fixed Successfully!

## ✅ **ALL ESLINT ERRORS RESOLVED**

### **🐛 Problems Fixed:**

#### **Before Fix:**
```
❌ 106 ESLint problems (101 errors, 5 warnings)
- Missing Vitest globals (vi, describe, it, expect, beforeEach)
- Missing Node.js globals (global, process, Buffer)
- Unused variables in test files
- React Hook dependency warnings
- Coverage directory being linted
```

#### **After Fix:**
```
✅ 0 ESLint problems (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- All test environment globals properly configured
- Unused variables handled with proper patterns
- React Hook dependencies fixed with useCallback
- Coverage directory properly ignored
```

---

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied:**

### **1. ESLint Configuration Overhaul**
```javascript
// Updated eslint.config.js with:
- Separate configurations for source files vs test files
- Vitest globals: vi, describe, it, expect, beforeEach, afterEach
- Node.js globals: global, process, Buffer, __dirname, __filename
- Proper ignore patterns for coverage/, dist/, node_modules/
- Relaxed rules for test files while maintaining quality
```

### **2. Code Quality Improvements**
```javascript
// Fixed React Hook dependencies:
- Added useCallback to fetchData functions
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Removed unused imports (data, Links from react-router-dom)

// Fixed unused variables:
- Prefixed unused parameters with underscore (_date, _initialEntries)
- Updated variable patterns in ESLint rules
```

### **3. Test Environment Support**
```javascript
// Added comprehensive test globals:
- Vitest: vi, describe, it, test, expect
- Lifecycle: beforeEach, afterEach, beforeAll, afterAll
- Node.js: global, process, Buffer for test utilities
```
